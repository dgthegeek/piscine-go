# Algorithm Solutions - Zone01 Dakar Piscine

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic problems and exercises from the piscine (intensive coding course) at Zone01 Dakar. The solutions are implemented in multiple programming languages.

## Languages

- JavaScript [https://github.com/dgthegeek/piscine-js]
- Go
- Java [https://github.com/dgthegeek/piscine-java]
- Rust [https://github.com/dgthegeek/piscine-rust]

Each language directory contains solutions to different problems and exercises.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions. Each file is named according to the problem it solves. You can run these solutions using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for each language.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own work during the piscine at Zone01 Dakar. They are meant for learning and reference purposes. Please adhere to your academic institution's guidelines on using external resources.
